# It supports two top level dictionaries:
#
# # List all the available locations
# locations:
#   - <azure-location-name>
#
# # List all the available subnets in supported locations
# subnets:
#   <azure-location-name>: <azure-subnet-id>
#
# Please do not move or edit the structure of that file as
# it's being actively used by the fuzzing team decision task
# to manage worker pools
